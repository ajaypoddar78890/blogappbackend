# AUTHENTICATION

# JWT-based user authentication involves two primary processes: registration and login, with added security measures such as password encryption.

# Registration: Users provide their details (username, email, password), and the server stores these in a database. The user's password is encrypted (hashed) before storage to enhance security.

# Login: Users enter their credentials, and the server validates them by comparing the hashed password with the stored version. If credentials are correct, a JWT is generated, containing user data and an expiration time. This token is sent to the client.

# Subsequent Requests: To access protected resources, the client includes the JWT in the request's Authorization header. The server verifies the token's integrity, decodes the payload, and checks user permissions before serving the request.

# JWT-based authentication offers a secure, stateless method for user access. It confirms user identity through credentials, generates tokens for subsequent authentication, and ensures user data protection through password encryption. This process enhances application security and user data privacy.
